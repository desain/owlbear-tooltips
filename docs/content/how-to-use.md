## How To Use

Install from the [Owlbear rogue store](https://owlbear.rogue.pub/extension/https://owlbear-tooltips.nicholassdesai.workers.dev/manifest.json).

This extension adds a new tool mode to the Text (T) tool.

While using this mode, click on a token to edit its tooltip. You can configure the tooltip appearance and visibility in the tooltip edit window.

![TODO edit window]

Once an item has a tooltip, you can hover over the item using the tooltip mode to preview the tooltip contents.

![hover preview]

When an item has a tooltip, shift-click on it to temporarily display the tooltip to all everyone.

When you select a token that has a tooltip, an info icon will appear in the corner of the token. Click this icon to display the tooltip, and click it again to hide the tooltip.

![info icon]

If you're the GM, you can customize where the tooltip icon appears using the Tooltip Settings menu, so the icon doesn't overlap UI elements created by other extensions.
